<t-half><strong>Writing</strong></t-half>
<p><t1>One of my favorite hobbies is writing ancient Chinese poems. Some of my works can be found <a href="https://csyhquan.github.io/category/poem/poem.html">here</a>. <br />I also wrote a <a href="https://github.com/csyhquan/csyhquan.github.io/raw/master/category/poem/PoemAssist.rar">program</a> for checking the rhythm errors of a ancient Chinese poem and assisting the writing.</t1></p>

<t-half><strong>Just for Fun</strong></t-half>
<p><t1>I made some mini games when I was a student. Sometimes I use them to relax myself when the research is stuck. Hope they can serve you as well. <br />Unluckily, no readme files could be provided currently for the games. You may have to explore the rules and runtime installations by yourself.<br>
