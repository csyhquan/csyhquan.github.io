<h4>Writing</h4>
<p>One of my favorite hobbies is writing ancient Chinese poems. Some of my works can be found <a href="https://csyhquan.github.io/category/poem/poem.html">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Just for Fun</h4>
<p>I made some mini games when I was a student. Sometimes I use them to relax myself when the research is stuck. Hope they can serve you as well. I was too lazy to write readme files for the games. You may have to explore the rules by yourself.</p>
