<h7><strong>Writing</strong></h7>
<p>One of my favorite hobbies is writing ancient Chinese poems. Some of my works can be found <a href="https://csyhquan.github.io/category/poem/poem.html">here</a>. I also wrote a <a href="https://github.com/csyhquan/csyhquan.github.io/raw/master/category/poem/PoemAssist.rar">program</a> for checking the rhythm errors of a ancient Chinese poem and assisting the writing.</p>

<h7><strong>Just for Fun</strong></h7>
<p>I made some mini games when I was a student. Sometimes I use them to relax myself when the research is stuck. Hope they can serve you as well. I was too lazy to write readme files for the games. You may have to explore the rules by yourself.<br>
